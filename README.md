# Tree Collector Project

## Description

This project is a Python application that simulates a tree collection game. The `Tree` class represents a tree with a trunk and a crown, which can be moved and has a score and color associated with it.

The game UI features a pause menu that allows users to resume or exit the game. If they choose to resume, their score is saved from before they paused, as well as the positions of any trees that
were displayed in the graphics window before the user paused the game.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you will need the graphics library installed.

## Usage

To run the project, you can use the following command:

```bash
python tree_collector.py
```

Upon running the above command, a new graphics window will automatically open up and you'll be able to start the game.
